## Data Collection and Usage

We are committed to user privacy. **We do not collect, store, share, or sell any of your personal data.**

### 1. Website Content
The extension temporarily scans the text of the web pages you visit solely for the purpose of identifying and converting currency amounts.
*   **Processing:** All processing happens locally on your device.
*   **Storage:** No website content is stored or transmitted to our servers.

### 2. User Settings
We store your preferences (such as your target currency, preferred rate display, and list of disabled websites) using your browser's local storage capabilities (`chrome.storage`).
*   **Sync:** If you are signed into your browser, these settings may be synced across your devices by your browser provider (e.g., Google). We do not have access to this data.

### 3. External Services
The extension fetches currency exchange rates from the **European Central Bank (ECB)**.
*   **Data:** This process involves a standard web request to `https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml` to retrieve public exchange rate data.
*   **Privacy:** No personal information or browsing history is sent to the ECB.

## Remote Code
